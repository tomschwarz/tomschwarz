### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tom.
#### I'm a software craftsman, husband and father.
I work full time as a software craftsman. In my spare time I love to read books which are related to programming and work on various open-source projects. So you can see, I love to learning new things which helps me to develop myself. I like to create and maintain low-level and TUI systems. I want to craft easy and exceptional software which makes fun to use.

Last but not least, a well brewed coffee is a poem to me.

Skills: C / C++ / PHP / JS / GNU+Linux

I'm a member of the Free Software Foundation. Without GNU/Linux and all the great work from people all over the world producing free software, all my projects would not have been possible.

Consider joining the FSF, [here is why](https://my.fsf.org/join?referrer=5002414).

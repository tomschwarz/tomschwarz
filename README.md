### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tom.
#### I'm a software craftsman, cyber security enthusiast, husband and father.
I work full time as a software craftsman. In my spare time I love to read books which are related to programming and cyber security. Also I love to hacking machines on [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/432703) and do some reverse engineering. Last but not least, I work on various open-source projects. So you can see, I love to learning new things which helps me to develop myself. 

I almost forgot: a well brewed coffee is a poem to me.

Skills: C / C++ / PHP / JS / PYTHON / BASH / ASSEMBLER / GNU+Linux

I'm a member of the Free Software Foundation. Without GNU/Linux and all the great work from people all over the world producing free software, all my projects would not have been possible.

Consider joining the FSF, [here is why](https://my.fsf.org/join?referrer=5002414).
